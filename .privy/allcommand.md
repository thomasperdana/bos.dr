Create a Sales Funnel

Create a Sales Funnel with dark blue theme and animation and infographics.
1. The Name
Stop calling it Database Reactivation. It sounds like IT work.
The Name: "The 72-Hour Revenue Rally"
The Tagline: "We turn your 'dead' leads into booked appointments in 3 days or you don't pay."
2. The Pricing Model
Avoid pure "RevShare" (business owners lie about numbers) and avoid "High Retainer" (too hard to sell cold).
Setup Fee: $297 - $497 (Covers your Twilio fees and validates they are serious).
Performance Fee: $50 - $100 per showed appointment (or booked appointment, depending on niche).
The Upsell (The Real Goal): After the first campaign wins, move them to a $297/month SaaS subscription to keep the "AI Receptionist" running forever.
3. The Risk Reversal (Guarantee)
"If we don't generate at least 5 qualified appointment requests within the first 72 hours of launch, I will refund your Setup Fee instantly. You have zero downside."
